<h1>For Loops</h1>

<p>There are many programming situations where you may want to have a section of code execute several times. For instance, let&rsquo;s say that we want to have a single, one measure rhythm play on track 1 for 8 measures. At first, we might take this approach to the problem:</p>

<pre data-original-title="" data-type="programlisting" title="">
from earsketch import *
init()
setTempo(120)

beat = &quot;0-00-00-0+++0+0+&quot;
drum = ELECTRO_DRUM_MAIN_BEAT_008

makeBeat(drum, 1, 1, beat)
makeBeat(drum, 1, 2, beat)
makeBeat(drum, 1, 3, beat)
makeBeat(drum, 1, 4, beat)
makeBeat(drum, 1, 5, beat)
makeBeat(drum, 1, 6, beat)
makeBeat(drum, 1, 7, beat)
makeBeat(drum, 1, 8, beat)

finish()
</pre>

<p>This will yield the desired results. However, there&rsquo;s a sign that there is a better way of doing things here&hellip; the code is very repetitive and difficult to read. Because programmers are always looking for simpler and clearer ways of representing common situations, there are techniques to accomplish the same thing while typing less. In this case, it would be much simpler to use a&nbsp;<strong><code style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 1em;">for</code>&nbsp;loop</strong>. The&nbsp;<code style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 1em;">for</code>&nbsp;loop structure makes the code appear much more readable and clearly indicates the logic. A&nbsp;<code style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 1em;">for</code>&nbsp;loop works by being given a certain range of values through which to operate. This range is described by the&nbsp;<code style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 1em;">range()</code>&nbsp;function.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<code style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 1em;">range()</code>&nbsp;function most commonly takes in 2 parameters, a starting point and an ending point. The starting point is<strong>&nbsp;inclusive</strong>, meaning that the starting number is included within the range. For example, if the starting number is 1, 1 is included within the range that the function is describing. On the other hand, the ending point parameter is&nbsp;<strong>exclusive</strong>, meaning that the ending number is not included within the range being described by the function. To be familiar with this concept, let&rsquo;s look at an example.</p>

<pre data-original-title="" data-type="programlisting" title="">
range(1,9)
</pre>

<p>The above call refers to the range of numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Notice that the starting point parameter, 1, is included within this list, whereas the ending point parameter, 9, is not. The starting point is inclusive and the ending point is exclusive.</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting">
range(3,7)</pre>

<p>This call refers to this range of numbers: 3, 4, 5, 6. Again, 3 is inclusive and 7 is exclusive.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<code style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 1em;">range()</code>&nbsp;function can also be implemented with only 1 parameter. If given a single parameter,&nbsp;<code style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 1em;">range()</code>&nbsp;will provide a range from 0 to that number. Remember, the ending point (the single parameter that was passed in) is still exclusive. Therefore, the following function call yields the range 0, 1, 2, 3, 4:</p>

<div class="syntaxhighlighter  " id="highlighter_977923">
<div class="lines" style="margin: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important; border: 0px !important; outline: 0px !important; background-image: none !important; float: none !important; vertical-align: baseline !important; position: static !important; left: auto !important; top: auto !important; right: auto !important; bottom: auto !important; height: auto !important; width: auto !important; line-height: 1.1em !important; font-size: 1em !important; direction: ltr !important;">
<div class="line alt1" style="margin: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important; border: 0px !important; outline: 0px !important; background-image: none !important; float: none !important; vertical-align: baseline !important; position: static !important; left: auto !important; top: auto !important; right: auto !important; bottom: auto !important; height: auto !important; width: auto !important; line-height: 1.1em !important; font-size: 1em !important; direction: ltr !important;">
<pre data-original-title="" data-type="programlisting" title="">
range(5)</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Additionally,&nbsp;<code style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 1em;">range()</code>&nbsp;can be used with three parameters. In this case, the first two parameters are the starting and ending points and the third parameter is a step variable. The step variable tells the range on what interval you want it to work. You can use the third parameter to create ranges of numbers that increase by two or four or any other number. For example, the following function call yields the range 0, 3, 6, 9:</p>

<div class="syntaxhighlighter  " id="highlighter_261776">
<div class="lines" style="margin: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important; border: 0px !important; outline: 0px !important; background-image: none !important; float: none !important; vertical-align: baseline !important; position: static !important; left: auto !important; top: auto !important; right: auto !important; bottom: auto !important; height: auto !important; width: auto !important; line-height: 1.1em !important; font-size: 1em !important; direction: ltr !important;">
<div class="line alt1" style="margin: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important; border: 0px !important; outline: 0px !important; background-image: none !important; float: none !important; vertical-align: baseline !important; position: static !important; left: auto !important; top: auto !important; right: auto !important; bottom: auto !important; height: auto !important; width: auto !important; line-height: 1.1em !important; font-size: 1em !important; direction: ltr !important;">
<pre data-type="programlisting">
range(10,0,3)</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The&nbsp;<code style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 1em;">range()</code>&nbsp;function is important within the use of loops because it provides a range of numbers for the loop to iterate through. Let&rsquo;s look at how the range function can be used with loops by reconsidering the problem presented at the beginning of this section: place a rhythm on track 1 of an EarSketch project for 8 measures.</p>

<pre data-original-title="" data-type="programlisting" title="">
from earsketch import *

#setup
init()
setTempo(120)

#variables
drum = ELECTRO_DRUM_MAIN_BEAT_008
beat = &quot;0-00-00-0+++0+0+&quot;

# using iteration instead of repeating similar lines of code
for measure in range(1, 9):
    makeBeat(drum, 1, measure, beat)

#finish
finish()
</pre>

<p>The variable&nbsp;<code style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 1em;">measure</code>&nbsp;is the&nbsp;<strong>index variable</strong>&nbsp;for the loop. As the loop iterates, or executes the statements inside the loop,&nbsp;<code style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 1em;">measure</code>&nbsp;will be assigned numbers from 1 through 8, based on the&nbsp;<code style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 1em;">range()</code>&nbsp;function.</p>

<p>As&nbsp;<code style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 1em;">measure</code>&nbsp;increases, so does the location value within the&nbsp;<code style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 1em;">makeBeat()</code>&nbsp;function that places your rhythm onto the timeline in Reaper. This loop will effectively place one rhythm on the first 8 measures of track 1. Compare this code with the code at the beginning of this section &mdash; both accomplish the same task, but the&nbsp;<code style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 1em;">for</code>&nbsp;loop makes the code significantly shorter and easier to read.</p>

<section data-type="sect1">
<h1>Fills</h1>

<p>Fills are components in music that can add some excitement to repetitive lines of music. This is a technique that is frequently implemented within drum tracks. For instance, there might be a repetitive drum beat like the one in our&nbsp;<a href="http://earsketch.gatech.edu/learning/for-loops/for-loops" style="color: rgb(33, 50, 209); font-weight: bold;" title="For Loops">previous example</a>. In order to make this repetitive loop more exciting, we might add a different beat on every fourth measure. This would create more interesting music where we have three measures of a consistent rhythm punctuated by some different rhythm.</p>

<p>In order to create a track with a consistent beat and a fill, we will use our knowledge of&nbsp;<code style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 1em;">for</code>&nbsp;loops and the&nbsp;<code style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 1em;">range</code>&nbsp;function. We will make use of the version of the&nbsp;<code style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 1em;">range</code>&nbsp;function that has three parameters (start, end, increment value) and a&nbsp;<code style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 1em;">for</code>&nbsp;loops to accomplish our task.</p>

<pre data-code-language="python" data-original-title="" data-type="programlisting" title="">
from earsketch import *

init()
setTempo(120)

beatPattern = '0-0-0-000+++0-0-'
fillPattern = '0++00++00+0+0000'

drum = ELECTRO_DRUM_MAIN_BEAT_001

for counter in range(1, 13, 4):
    # three measures of a standard pattern
    makeBeat(drum, 1, counter,  beatPattern)
    makeBeat(drum, 1, counter + 1, beatPattern)
    makeBeat(drum, 1, counter + 2, beatPattern)
    # one measure of a fill pattern
    makeBeat(drum, 1, counter + 3, fillPattern)

finish()

<h1>Conditionals</h1>

<p>Often, we will want the computer to be able to compare two values and perform an action based on the relationship between those two values. For example, if a measure number is divisible by 2 (i.e., if it&rsquo;s an even measure), we might want to add percussion to the measure. Otherwise, we might want to add guitars to that measure. There are two steps in this process:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Check</strong>&nbsp;whether a variable has a particular relationship to a value or another variable, and</li>
	<li><strong>Perform an action</strong>&nbsp;(or a series of actions, or no action) based on the result of this check.</li>
</ul>

<p>These two steps combine to form a&nbsp;<strong>conditional</strong>&nbsp;in computer programming. &nbsp;This name comes from the idea that &nbsp;the first step involves the computer checking whether or not a certain condition has been met. A conditional tells the computer to perform an action if the condition is met, and to perform a separate action if the condition is not met. (Keep in mind that either one of these actions can be to do nothing at all.)</p>

<p>We use conditionals in our everyday lives. Consider grocery shopping &ndash; how do you know whether or not you should purchase a carton of milk? Before you go shopping, you&nbsp;<strong>check</strong>your fridge to see if you already have milk. If you don&rsquo;t, then you buy some at the store; if you do, then you don&rsquo;t buy any. In this case, the condition you are checking is whether or not you have milk in your fridge, and the action you are performing is buying milk at the store.</p>

<p>The milk example illustrates an important point about conditionals &ndash; they can be written as &ldquo;if-then&rdquo; statements. For this example, the conditional would be phrased as: &ldquo;If there is no milk in the fridge, then you should buy some at the store.&rdquo; In programming, the &ldquo;if&rdquo; part of the conditional will typically involve a comparison. The &ldquo;then&rdquo; part is written below the &ldquo;if&rdquo; part and is always indented; if there are multiple actions to be performed within the &ldquo;then&rdquo; part, they should all be indented. Consider the following code:</p>

<pre data-original-title="" data-type="programlisting" title="">
checkValue = 1
if checkValue == 1:
    fitMedia(HIPHOP_SYNTH_LEAD_001, 1, 1, 3)
</pre>

<p>This illustrates the typical structure of a conditional. &nbsp;Line 2 compares the value of&nbsp;<code style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 1em;">checkValue</code>&nbsp;to 1 to see if the two are equal. If they are, the &ldquo;then&rdquo; part of the conditional on line 3 is executed, and drums are added to track 1; if they aren&rsquo;t, the &ldquo;then&rdquo; part of the conditional is not executed. If the value of&nbsp;<code style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 1em;">checkValue</code>&nbsp;were changed to 2, for example, nothing would happen &ndash; no audio clip would be added to the song.</p>

<p>Notice how the &ldquo;if&rdquo; statement in line 2 compares two values using the &ldquo;==&rdquo; sign (also called a &ldquo;double equals&rdquo; sign); this is different than the single &ldquo;=&rdquo; sign we use when&nbsp;<a data-original-title="Intro to Music Programming in EarSketch: Variables" href="http://earsketch.gatech.edu/learning/intro-to-music-programming-in-earsketch/variables" style="color: rgb(33, 50, 209); font-weight: bold;" title="">assigning variables</a>. When you see the &ldquo;==&rdquo; sign, it means the computer is performing a comparison. Other comparisons can be used in the &ldquo;if&rdquo; part of the conditional: greater than (&gt;), less than (&lt;), greater than or equal to (&gt;=), less than or equal to (&gt;=), and not equal to (!=). For example, if the second line in the previous example were changed to</p>
